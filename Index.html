                <p>Hello everyone! We have updates to share, please make sure to read everything!</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for believing in the project and deciding to have fun and play with us! We have reached almost 100 unique accounts created!</p>
<h3>Server Updates</h3>
<p>The server is going to be updated today and will include the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Founder system implementation</strong>: To thank all of our early players, everyone who has played until now and everyone who plays until the 25th of August (included) will be forever recognized as a Founder. What does this mean? Your account will be flagged as a Founder, meaning that <strong>forever</strong>, every new character you create will automatically receive the <span style="color: green;">[Founder]</span> title and a <span style="color: magenta;">[Pink Poo]</span> mascot sent by Mail (check your System Mail tab!) by Arale itself! So make sure to spread the word to family, friends, and strangers so everyone can benefit from this once-in-a-lifetime reward! <em>Note: Existing characters will also receive both rewards, don't worry!</em></li>
<li><strong>Pet Fusion fixes</strong>: You can now fuse pets without using any items, with a 70% success rate. Using an item will guarantee a successful fusion.</li>
<li><strong>Animation fixes</strong>: Previously, monsters were frozen between each attack animation; now they will properly idle between attacks. Also, player attack animations will feel smoother now.</li>
<li><strong>Knockdown / Slip mechanics</strong>: If you managed to finish the combo of all normal attack animations (6 in total, unlocked at level 20), you'd have a 100% chance to either knock down the enemy or make it slip. This is implemented now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Client Updates</h3>
<p>The client has also received some updates, so please make sure to go to the account panel on the website and download them!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More localization fixes</strong>:<ul>
<li>Identified the <strong>real</strong> cause of the crashes related to reflected damage. They have been correctly fixed, and the reflected damage will properly show in the combat log now. <strong>Unless you update your client, you will crash again, so please update it as soon as possible!</strong></li>
<li>Improvements to early Human quests and random dialogs around the world.</li>
<li>Improved some UI elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Updates</h3>
<p>We also enabled more commands for players. This is the current list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>@online</strong>: Shows the number of currently online players.</li>
<li><strong>@addmasteritem</strong>: Adds the item used to complete the master quest for your class, in case you lose it by accident. Can only be used after you accept it from Korin.</li>
<li><strong>@addskill2</strong>: Unlocks the master class passive skill, in case a bug causes you to lose it. Can only be used after you have unlocked your master class.</li>
<li><strong>@addhtb</strong>: Unlocks the main HTB and master class HTB, if you have already learned them. This is meant to be used after a skill reset. Can only be used after you have unlocked your master class.</li>
<li><strong>@unstuck</strong>: Teleports you back to your Popo Stone if you are stuck.</li>
<li><strong>@resetexp</strong>: Resets your level experience to 0.</li>
<li><strong>@exp (on/off)</strong>: Toggles whether your character continues to gain experience or not. It is used to continue farming without gaining any more levels, to gather gear for kid budokai, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck and have fun! üêâ‚ú®</p>

                <p>Greetings everyone! The beta testing phase is over, and we are proud to announce that our server has finally been publicly launched!

<h3>Announcing Dragon Ball Online Classic: Relive the Adventure!</h3>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball Online Classic</strong>, a community-driven project dedicated to preserving the legacy of one of the most beloved MMORPGs inspired by the iconic work of Akira Toriyama, is now open to the public!</p>
<h3>Smooth Gameplay Experience</h3>
<p>DBO Classic uses the original Taiwanese client, enhanced for seamless gameplay across modern operating systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 10 Compatibility:</strong> We‚Äôve fixed freezes that occur on modern operating systems like Windows 10, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay on any machine.</li>
<li><strong>Linux Support:</strong> The game‚Äôs compatibility with Linux has been thoroughly tested using wine, allowing Linux-based players to enjoy the game without technical hurdles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complete English Translation</h3>
<p>Thanks to the dedicated team at OpenDBO, we‚Äôve achieved a 100% translation of all in-game content into English. From quest dialogues to item descriptions, every aspect of the game has been meticulously translated for a seamless and immersive experience for English-speaking players. You can review and contribute to the localization project on OpenDBO‚Äôs GitHub repository.</p>
<h3>Own Your Adventure: Character Data Backups</h3>
<p>We offer unique character data backup features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Download Data:</strong> Save your character's stats, inventory, and progress to your local device at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Transfer Servers:</strong> Take your character on new adventures by transferring your backup data to a different server.</li>
<li><strong>Preserve Legacy:</strong> Even if you take a break from the game, backups ensure your character's story is never lost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interactive Systems: NetPy Points Adjustment</h3>
<p>Earn NetPy Points by defeating monsters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each monster defeated grants 1 point, with the chance of receiving none or even doubling the points earned.</li>
<li>This chance is influenced by the level difference between the player and the monster, adding excitement to gameplay and discouraging the need to stay connected continuously just to collect points.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessible Gameplay: In-game Cash Point Generation</h3>
<p>To ensure all players can access in-game items without spending real money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each NetPy Point generated has a small chance of also generating a Cash Point.</li>
<li>Use Cash Points in the shop to purchase items, allowing players to acquire premium content through regular gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p>This promotes inclusivity and fairness, letting all players enjoy the full range of in-game content.</p>
